# Rank Top 100 DJs

Ever wondering that how those top DJs lists like DJ Mag's Top 100 DJs and Billboard Dance 100 being composited? 

There are many ways to rank DJs. Some charts are based on [polls](https://djmag.com/news/top-100-djs-poll-2018-next-50), some based on how many venues a DJ has played in a period, or how many times their mixes/remixes are played on air. But the data they used to do a ranking is actually very hard to get if you are not in the industry. So here are some methods I came up with to rank DJs with public accessible data.

## List of Ways to Rank DJs 
- 1. Based on how many times the original mixs have been remixed and released by other artists.
- 2. How many times the remixes a DJ composited are more popluar than the original ones from the original artists.
- 3. More to come..


## 1. Based on Remixed by Other Artists

### Data

I'll use the data from [genius.com](https://genius.com/) which has song data with original author and remixer info. And the guys in genius.com are cool that they provide a free API for nerds like me to access the data.
